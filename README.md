# Regulus: Authenticated Encryption

## üöÄ Overview

The goal of this project was to build a secure messaging system that provides **confidentiality** and **integrity** using authenticated encryption. The system is designed to prevent a powerful attacker from being able to read, modify, or replay messages, even with full control over the network.

All cryptographic operations are implemented using a minimal and secure set of primitives provided by the project harness. The project enforces careful design decisions around nonce management, key separation, and tamper detection.

## üîí Features

- **Authenticated Encryption (Encrypt-then-MAC):** Messages are encrypted and authenticated using AES-CTR and HMAC-SHA256.
- **Unique Nonce Generation:** Ensures nonces are never reused under the same key.
- **Replay Protection:** Rejects duplicated ciphertexts using a set of seen nonces.
- **Tampering Detection:** Automatically detects and rejects modified or truncated messages.
